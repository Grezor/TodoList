## Introduction
Following my work-linked training, my company asked me to create a todoList. With Javascript and NodeJS languages
The todoList uses APIs with the Express socket. Routes to add or remove tasks. But also to be able to edit 
a stain, or to finish it off.

## Installation
For the installation of the project everything is explained in the **chapters folder**, then the **installation** directory. 

## Technologies
```
Javascript, CSS, HTML
```
## Start
- On Github, go to the main page of the project
- Open a terminal, or git bash
- Replace the current working directory with the location where you want to clone it.
- Type ```git clone https://github.com/Grezor/Todolist.git ```
- Press on ```Entry```
- Once the installation is complete, type **npm -i** in the terminal.     Install the dependencies in the local node_modules folder.
- Type : **npm start** in the terminal
- result terminal : 
```

## API
API is an acronym for Applications Programming Interface. An API is therefore a programming interface that allows you to "plug in" to an application to exchange data. It operates on an input/output agreement, it is a distribution channel. A API is open and offered by the program owner. It is a concept and an intangible element.
